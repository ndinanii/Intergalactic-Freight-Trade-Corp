## 🔍 What's Actually Happening

You mentioned:
> "I added the Object Tabs to my App called Freight Agent Console, but can't see the custom objects. As a system admin"

**Key Question:** What exactly can't you see?

### Scenario 1: Tabs Don't Appear in App Navigation
**If you don't see the tabs when using the Freight Agent Console app:**

1. **Hard Refresh Your Browser**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Clear Salesforce Cache**
   - Click your profile icon (top right)
   - Go to **Settings**
   - Search for "Clear Cache"
   - Or log out and log back in

3. **Verify Tab Assignment in App**
   ```
   Setup → App Manager → Find "Freight Agent Console" → Edit
   → Navigation Items → Check "Selected Items" list
   ```
   
   Make sure these are in **Selected Items** (not just Available):
   - ✅ Shipments
   - ✅ Cargo
   - ✅ Customs Documents

### Scenario 2: Tabs Show But No Data Loads
**If tabs appear but list views don't load:**

This is normal! There's no data yet. The test record we just created proves the objects work.

**To see data:**
1. Click the **Shipments** tab
2. You should see the test record "TEST-SHIP-001"
3. If not, create a new list view or check existing view filters

### Scenario 3: Tabs Hidden Behind "More" Dropdown
**Lightning Apps have limited space in navigation:**

If you have many tabs, Salesforce puts extras in the "More" dropdown (•••)

**Solution:** Rearrange tabs in App Manager:
```
Setup → App Manager → Freight Agent Console → Edit
→ Navigation Items → Drag tabs to top of list
```

## 🚀 Quick Verification Steps

2. Search for "Freight Agent Console"

### Step 3: Look for Tabs

- 🚚 **Shipments**
- ✈️ **Cargo**  
- 📄 **Customs Documents**

### Step 4: Click Shipments Tab
1. Click the **Shipments** tab
2. You should see a list view

## 🎯 Create Sample Data to Test

Once tabs are visible, create test data:

```powershell
# Create a Shipment
sf data create record --sobject Shipment__c --values "Name='DEMO-001'" --target-org "wonga myendeki"

# Create a Cargo (you'll need a Shipment Id first)
sf data create record --sobject Cargo__c --values "Name='CARGO-001',Shipment__c='<SHIPMENT_ID>',Category__c='Electronics',Weight__c=100" --target-org "wonga myendeki"
```

Or create via UI:
1. Click **Shipments** tab
2. Click **New** button
3. Enter a name (e.g., "My First Shipment")
4. Click **Save**

---

## 📞 Still Not Working?

If after trying all the above you still can't see the tabs, please provide:

1. **Screenshot of your app navigation bar** (showing which tabs you DO see)
2. **Screenshot of App Manager** (showing Freight Agent Console → Selected Items)
3. **Confirm:** 
   - Can you see "Shipment__c" in Object Manager? (You said yes ✅)
   - Are you logged in as System Administrator? (You said yes ✅)
   - Are you in the "Freight Agent Console" app? (Check app name in header)
